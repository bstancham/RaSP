#+TITLE: RASP: [R]esize [A]nd [Sp]lit Images for Printing

* Introduction

RASP is a simple python program which resizes images and splits them into
sections for printing on multiple sheets of paper and outputs a multi-page PDF
document.

* Usage

EXAMPLE: resize input image to 1000mm wide and split up for printing on multiple
sheets of A4 paper:

: python rasp.py -w 1000 -i alien-storm.png

Command Line Options:
- -w = target width
- -h = target height
- -p = paper size (a4|a3) (a4 is the default)
- -i = input image

* Dependencies
- getopt
- img2pdf
- numpy
- PIL/Pillow

* Possible Issues

A couple of known bugs are described on the img2pdf PyPi page:
https://pypi.org/project/img2pdf/

Solutions are provided in both cases.
